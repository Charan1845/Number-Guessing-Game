This is a Number guessing game 
The Algorithm I followed is:
1)We need to generate a small number
2)Mention the range like (1-10 or 1-50)
3) let user give the number
4) if number is less than 5 small print too close(low than the number)
5) else if number is more than 10 print too far
6) and user should have only 5 chances
7) added if user exceeds the number of chances then end
